=======================

We're looking for feedback on this [Learn Chef](http://learn.chef.io) tutorial that we plan to provide as a new user's first experience working with Chef.

We're working on a way to provide users with all the necessary EC2 resources. But for now, we ask you to bring your own.

Specifically, we're looking for feedback regarding:

* Whether the steps provided worked for you as expected.
* What you found to be delightful about it, as well as what areas could benefit from additional explanation or made easier to do.

You can find the code that represents the end state of this tutorial in the `chef-repo` directory.

You can provide feedback through the open pull request, or email me at [tpetchel@get.io](mailto:tpetchel@chef.io).

Thank you for your time and help. We hope you enjoy it!
